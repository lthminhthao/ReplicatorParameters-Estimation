\textbf{Site-ordering by “stability-of-largest-coexistence” first, increasing strain-number second.} Here the data are fitted in the following order: Nepal$\to$ Brazil$\to$ Denmark$\to$ Mozambique $\to$ Iran, with Nepal data being fitted before all others, as a stable coexistence equilibrium of 69 serotypes. 
We estimate the parameters for Nepal first, followed by the other countries. This approach is necessary because computing the eigenvalues (to verify stable equilibrium) of the Jacobian matrix of Nepal's fitness matrix (size $69 \times 69$) is computationally intensive and challenging due to the lower degrees of freedom.
Within remaining countries, the process is carried out in the following order: from Brazil, to Denmark, to Mozambique, Iran, respectively, based on their number of coexisting strains $n$, starting from the site with smallest number of reported serotypes. 
In the second case, we re-scale the $\alpha_{ij}$ variance, immediately after the first country estimation, to match that obtained in Order 1, so that we can compare the resulting interaction parameter distributions between the two methods under the same scale.
