Codes for Parameter Estimation in Order 1 (Brazil-Denmark-Mozambique-Iran-Nepal)
Site-ordering by “increasing strain number” (lowest → highest number of strains). 
The process is carried in a particular optimized order: from Brazil → Denmark → Mozambique→ Iran → Nepal, respectively, based on their number of empirically-observed
strains n, starting from the site with smallest number of reported serotypes. 
In this ordering, the first 3 countries are assumed to represent a snapshot of the dynamics, whereas for Iran and Nepal (case 1) a stable steady state is more plausible. Since for Nepal µ = 3.95, we also
considered the possibility of data reflecting also a snapshot of the dynamics (case 2) but this fit gave higher error.
